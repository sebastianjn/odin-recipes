 <h1>The Genuine Gin and Tonic</h1>
    <img id="ginandtonic" alt="A Gin and Tonic" src="ginandtonic.jpeg">

    <p> The Gin and Tonic is a cocktail made with a gin and tonic water poured over a large amount of ice. 
        It was invented by the English for their armies during the occupation of India because the tonic water 
        contained quinine, which was a common malaria cure. Today the drink is a favorite of anyone who enjoys a refreshing
        afternoon cocktail. The Genuine Gin and Tonic expands upon this drink with its own flavorful flair.
